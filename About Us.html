    <h2 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(143, 9, 9)">The Taj Mahal Story</h2>
    
    
<blockquote> 
  <p style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size: 25px" ><b>Who could ever think that an eternal love leading to the saga of infinite bondage could evolve out of a desert-like land and <br> to be the reason to gift our world a poem-in-marble, The Taj!</b></p>
  <p style= font-size:25px> No image of The Taj, neither on canvas nor on celluloid, can adequately express its conceptual imaginary nor convey the legend, the poetry and the romance that shrouds what Rabindranath Tagore calls "a teardrop on the cheek of time".
    The Taj Mahal is a spectacle in white marble, unparalleled in the grandeur that depicts the sheer luxury of an era. The remarkable structure, the monument of love that Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan gave to the world, is a testimony of his intense love for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
    It is a romance celebrated in marble and glorified with precious and semi-precious stones, and that's the way to appreciate it! </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(143, 9, 9)">The Maker of Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p style= font-size:25px><b>SHAHAB UDDIN MUHAMMAD SHAH JAHAN</b> I ruled India from 1628 until 1658. His name comes from Persian, meaning "King of the World."He was the fifth Mughal ruler. He succeeded to the throne upon his father's death in 1627. He is considered one of the greatest Mughals, and his reign has been called the Golden Age of Mughals. Shah Jahan erected many splendid monuments, the most famous of which is the Taj Mahal at Agra.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(143, 9, 9)">The Cause of Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p style= font-size:25px><b>Arjumand Banu Begum</b>, popularly known as <b>MumtƒÅz Mahal</b>, meaning "beloved ornament of the palace", was an Empress of India during the Mughal Dynasty. Betrothed to Prince Shah Jahan in 1607 AD at the age of 14 years, she was married five years later on 10 May 1612. She was his third wife and became his favourite. Mumtaz Mahal had a profound and loving marriage with Shah Jahan.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(143, 9, 9)">The Architecture of Taj Mahal</h2> 

    <p style= font-size:25px>The Taj Mahal represents the finest and most sophisticated Mughal architecture. It is one of the most famous and recognisable buildings in the world. While the large, domed marble mausoleum is the most familiar part of the monument, the Taj Mahal is an extensive complex of buildings and gardens that extends over 22.44 hectares (55.5 acres). It includes subsidiary tombs, waterworks infrastructure, the small town of 'Taj Ganji' to the south and a 'moonlight garden' to the north of the river. Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 AD (1041 AH) on the south bank of the River Yamuna in Agra and was substantially complete by 1648 AD (1058 AH). The design was conceived as an earthly replica of the house of Mumtaz Mahal in paradise and an instrument of propaganda for the emperor.</p>
